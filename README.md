# assistant1
The project was to create an initial **LLM**-based assistant/chatbot locally on a **Windows** computer running a **WSL Ubuntu** image.  As with most projects, the focus was initially to get something running quickly with the intent to make more current, robust, etc. moving forward.

The steps required for the project are described in a two part article on **Medium**. [Part 1](https://medium.com/@elastingbob/quickly-build-a-local-assistant-and-impress-your-friends-part-1-d4283fa50771) describes setting up the environment. [Part 2](https://medium.com/@elastingbob/quickly-build-a-local-assistant-and-impress-your-friends-part-2-83297292e6e5) presents the code used.

The intention is to write-up and publish the more robust version in the near future. The next version will use workflows heavily to tie in features and implement long term memory. It more heavily leverages the **LangChain/LangGraph** features.
